This python algorithm can be used to sort an array.

How does it work?

It iterates trough the array and finds the smallest number. It appends that to the "sorted" array and removes it from the array of numbers. It continues this until there are no more values to work with. Then it returns the sorted array!

It isn't really efficent but it does the job!
